# Overview

## Topics

**Introduction to Generative AI in T&Lfine** [:link:](workshop1)
- Basics of AI, uses of AI in education, tips and tricks, ethical implications, Spark.

**AI-Resilient Assessment Design**
- Preparing educators with strategies to update and design assessments that minimise academic misconduct risks associated with the use of generative AI, emphasising the integrity and fairness of evaluations.

**Developing Creative Teaching Materials**
- Using AI to create engaging and innovative educational content that is Canvas and PowerPoint compatible (creative media with AI – videos, images, sounds, and so on).

**Personalised Learning Through AI (finetuning Spark)**
- Customising learning experiences to meet diverse student needs (creating chatbots or specialised LLM for your subjects).

**AI-Enhanced Formative Assessments**
- Integrating AI tools for responsible and continuous assessment and feedback.

## Design

Each 90-minute session is divided into two primary components:

- **Facilitator-led activities - Practical demonstrations**: This part of the session focuses on introducing key AI concepts and demonstrating practical uses of AI tools relevant to the module’s focus. All participants engage in similar hands-on guided activities (participants to follow facilitator-led activities).
- **Participants-led activities - Hands-on activities**: Participants engage in hands-on activities applying what they’ve learned to develop or refine AI-enhanced teaching materials and strategies specific to their academic disciplines (supported by facilitators).

As each workshop's session is repeated up to six times over the course of two weeks, participants can choose one session per module that best aligns with their schedule, ensuring maximum flexibility and accessibility. The repetitive scheduling of sessions ensures that all participants have an equal opportunity to engage with the content in a timely and convenient manner without having to rearrange their existing commitments. By offering multiple sessions for each module, our workshops should allow educators to integrate this training into their schedules, enhancing the likelihood of widespread participation and engagement.

Activities within workshops will be designed considering the use of Spark (but may also involve the use of different LLM depending on explored scenarios and examples). Sessions will be held across different locations on our campus (Parkville, VCA, and others).

We will use a registration link to monitor participation interest in the workshops.
