# Scenario (ESS 2022)

## Setting Context for Activity 1

The subject **Software Design and Architecture (SWEN90007)** at the University of Melbourne focuses on the in-depth study of software architectures, including the principles, techniques, and tools required for creating, developing, and evaluating these architectures. It covers a range of topics such as design styles, architectural patterns, design strategies, domain-specific architectures, and the evaluation of designs. The subject aims to help students analyse large-scale distributed systems, select appropriate architectures, and make suitable trade-offs between different architectural options.

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Analyse large-scale and distributed systems to select suitable architectures.
- Evaluate software architectures qualitatively and quantitatively.
- Make informed trade-offs between different architectural designs.

### Assessment

The assessment consists of a team-based project divided into three parts, submitted throughout the semester. Each submission focuses on various aspects of architectural design and implementation, with individual contributions moderated to ensure fair assessment. To pass, students must achieve at least 50% in the team-based project.

This report lists all comments entered by students.

```text
 - Less vague project requirements.
 - Less workload â€“ this is too much for students.
 - Lecture slides with code can be challenging to read.
 - Project part 2 was too big for the time given and expectations were not always clear.
 - Feedback needs to be provided sooner.
 - Marking rubric for reports depends on the tutor's personal feelings.
 - Marking rubrics were under-specified for parts 2, 3, and 4.
 - Team members were not friendly.
 - Need more guidance on assignments in tutorials.
 - Would like more activities in the classroom.
