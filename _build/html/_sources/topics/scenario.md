# Scenario (SES 2022)

What would have improved your learning experience in this subject?

This report lists all comments entered by students.

```text
 - More refined/less vague project requirements 
 - Less workload – this is too much for student studying full time.
 - I think the lecture slides can be a bit challenging to read – especially the code part. I think the problem is that, when we try to put lots of code on one slide, then the text become rather small. Not sure what would be a better way though...
 - The project part 2 was far too big for the time given and I feel like some expectations for that part were not overly clear. I really enjoyed the subject otherwise 
 - Feedback needs to be provided sooner
 - Marking rubric for reports, extremely depends on tutor's personal feelings
 - Our team really felt the marking rubrics were under specified for parts 2, 3, and 4.
 - Even though the performance stuff was kind of tacked onto the end of the course, I'm really glad it was covered, as it wasn't something I had ever even considered when doing application development. In future, it would be nice to have a bit more guidance in this area.
 - Team members is not friendly 
 - Tutorials
 - I will appreciate if there could be more guidances on assignments in tutorials 
 - I would like more activities in classroom
