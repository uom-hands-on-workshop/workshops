   - **Task**: Improve outcomes by considering additional context.
      - (human) Write an improved prompt to list identified problems in students' comments.
      - (human) Ask the LLM to design a prompt to list identified problems in students' comments.
      - (human) Compare prompts' results, merge and polish your final prompt.  

  3. Selection of One Idea and Content Development
