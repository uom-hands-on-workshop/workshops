# Welcome

Welcome to our Introduction to Generative AI in Education Through Hands-on Workshops! We're excited to have you join us on this journey of integrating cutting-edge AI technologies into education. These workshops have been carefully designed, reviewed, and managed by a dedicated staff team at the University of Melbourne. Our goal is to equip educators - through hands-on and contextualised workshops - with the knowledge and tools to leverage generative AI in their teaching practices, fostering innovation, enhancing AI literacy, and addressing ethical considerations. As technology evolves, so will our workshops. We are committed to continuously updating and offering new sessions to keep pace with advancements in AI.

## Key Activities

- **Hands-on exercises** with AI tools such as Spark, ChatGPT, Claude, Co-Pilot, DALL-E, Midjourney.
- Role-playing sessions to explore ethical scenarios and academic integrity issues.
- Group discussions to foster collaboration and share best practices.
- Design and development of resources to be shared on Teams.

## Expected Outcomes

Leverage AI Literacy among participants. Participants will gain practical skills in using AI to enhance their teaching and learning methods (conscious, informed, responsible decisions). They will also develop a better understanding of the ethical considerations involved in deploying AI technologies in educational settings, fully aligned with UOM guidelines and policies.

All developed materials will be made available to participants. Anyone should be able to reuse them in their faculties or lectures.
