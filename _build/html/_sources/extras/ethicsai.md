## AI Ethics

### Understanding AI Ethics

AI ethics involves ensuring that AI technologies are developed and used responsibly. Key ethical principles include fairness, accountability, transparency, and privacy.

### Ethical Concerns in AI

- **Bias and Fairness**: AI systems can perpetuate biases present in training data. Educators must teach students to recognise and address these biases.
- **Accountability**: Determining who is responsible for decisions made by AI systems.
- **Transparency**: Ensuring that AI systems are understandable and their decision-making processes are clear.
- **Privacy**: Ensuring that AI systems respect user privacy and handle data securely.
- **Misuse**: Preventing the use of AI for harmful purposes, such as spreading misinformation.

### Teaching AI Ethics

Incorporate discussions on AI ethics into the curriculum. Use real-world examples to illustrate ethical dilemmas and encourage students to think critically about the impact of AI on society.

### Responsible Practices with GenAI

As part of our commitment to fostering innovative and ethical educational practices, we provide various resources, including generative AI prompts, to enhance your T&L experience. It's crucial to approach these tools with a mindset geared towards responsible use and collaboration. When using generative AI in your T&L, consider the following practices to ensure effectiveness, responsibility, awareness and integrity:

- **Understand the Limitations**: Recognise that generative AI tools are not infallible and should be used as assistants rather than replacements for human judgment.
- **Verify the Output**: Always review and test outputs or content generated by AI to ensure it meets your requirements and standards.
- **Cite Your Sources**: Make sure to acknowledge the use of these tools in your documentation when appropriate.
- **Respect Privacy and Confidentiality**: Be cautious when feeding sensitive or proprietary data into generative AI systems, as this may raise privacy and confidentiality concerns. This is why we strongly recommend you use **[Spark](https://spark.unimelb.edu.au/)**.

#### Responsibility and Ownership

While AI can automate parts of the creative T&L process, do not delegate critical decisions or ethical judgments to AI. Instead, if you decide to use genAI in your T&L process, use AI-generated content as a starting point for further development and refinement. The use of these technologies must be continuously reviewed and evaluated by experts (humans).
