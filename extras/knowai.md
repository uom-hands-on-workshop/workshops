# Know and Understand AI

## What is AI?

AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses various technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks.

## Basic AI Concepts

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The ability of machines to understand and respond to human language.
- **Neural Networks**: Computational models inspired by the human brain, used in deep learning to recognise patterns and make complex decisions.

## Importance of AI Literacy

AI literacy involves understanding these basic concepts and how they are applied in everyday life. It is crucial for educators to grasp these ideas to effectively integrate AI into their teaching practices and help students navigate a future where AI is ubiquitous.
