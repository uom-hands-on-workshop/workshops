## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content, including code, text, images, and more, based on the training data they have been fed. In software engineering, generative AI can assist in various tasks, such as coding, documentation, and testing, thereby augmenting the development process.

## Responsible Practices

As part of our commitment to fostering innovative and ethical educational practices, we provide various resources, including generative AI prompts, to enhance your T&L experience. It's crucial to approach these tools with a mindset geared towards responsible use and collaboration. When using generative AI in your T&L, consider the following practices to ensure effectiveness, responsibility, awareness and integrity:

- **Understand the Limitations**: Recognise that generative AI tools are not infallible and should be used as assistants rather than replacements for human judgment.
- **Verify the Output**: Always review and test outputs or content generated by AI to ensure it meets your requirements and standards.
- **Cite Your Sources**: Make sure to acknowledge the use of these tools in your documentation when appropriate.
- **Respect Privacy and Confidentiality**: Be cautious when feeding sensitive or proprietary data into generative AI systems, as this may raise privacy and confidentiality concerns. This is why we strongly recommend you use **[Spark](https://spark.unimelb.edu.au/)**.

### AI as a Collaborative Tool

Generative AI offers significant potential to aid in the creative and development T&L processes. However, it's essential to view AI as a partner, not a replacement for your work, contributions and critical thinking. Use AI to generate ideas, draft solutions, and explore possibilities, but remember that the final generated outcomes should reflect your unique contribution and understanding. You are in control and should continue to make informed-decisions in this interactive process with AI.

### Responsibility and Ownership

While AI can automate parts of the creative T&L process, do not delegate critical decisions or ethical judgments to AI. Instead, if you decide to use genAI in your T&L process, use AI-generated content as a starting point for further development and refinement. The use of these technologies must be continuously reviewed and evaluated by experts (humans).

### Critical Review and Informed Decisions

Again, every piece of AI-generated content should be critically evaluated and reviewed. Inspect/Examine the relevance, accuracy, and appropriateness of the content in the context of its use. 


## Recommendations

- **Start Small**: Initially, use generative AI for smaller tasks as you become familiar with its capabilities and limitations.
- **Collaborate and Discuss**: Use generative AI as a tool for brainstorming and collaboration among team members, enhancing creativity and efficiency.
- **Stay Updated**: Generative AI technology is rapidly evolving. Keep yourself updated on the latest developments and tools that can benefit your projects. When in doubt, ask colleagues in the GenAI CoP (for example) for advice.


## Conclusion

Generative AI holds great promise for the field of education, offering tools that can significantly enhance learning, creativity, and productivity. By following the practices outlined above, participating in our workshops, and exploring the recommended resources, you can effectively incorporate these technologies into your T&L.

Remember, the goal is to use generative AI as a complement to your skills, in responsible ways, enabling you to achieve more while maintaining high standards of quality and integrity in your work.
