# AI Ethics

## Understanding AI Ethics

AI ethics involves ensuring that AI technologies are developed and used responsibly. Key ethical principles include fairness, accountability, transparency, and privacy.

## Ethical Concerns in AI

- **Bias and Fairness**: AI systems can perpetuate biases present in training data. Educators must teach students to recognise and address these biases.
- **Accountability**: Determining who is responsible for decisions made by AI systems.
- **Transparency**: Ensuring that AI systems are understandable and their decision-making processes are clear.

## Teaching AI Ethics

Incorporate discussions on AI ethics into the curriculum. Use real-world examples to illustrate ethical dilemmas and encourage students to think critically about the impact of AI on society.
