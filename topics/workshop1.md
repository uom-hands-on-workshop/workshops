# Workshop 1

## Introduction to Generative AI in T&L

**Total Duration**: 90 mins  
**Objective**: Equip participants with foundational knowledge of generative AI, educational applications, tips and tricks, ethical considerations, and LLMs (Spark, ChatGPT, others).  
**Pre-workshop reading?**: No prior reading required. **Please bring your computer to have fun with us :)**  
**Pre workshop survey**: TBC (add link here)

## Purpose of Workshop 1

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce educators to the fundamental concepts of generative AI and its applications in teaching and learning. No previous experience using generative AI is required. EVERYONE belongs here and is welcome to this session. 

In this initial workshop, we will navigate ways to collaborate with generative AI tools to address SES comments and improve students' experiences in our subjects. Participants will gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience with AI tools, learn how to apply these tools to enhance their teaching practices, and explore the ethical implications of using AI in education.

## Out of Scope

While this workshop aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to generative AI in teaching and learning, there are several topics that will not be covered in this session. These include:

- **Assessment Design**: Detailed strategies for designing AI-resilient assessments are covered in a separate workshop.
- **Creation of Fine-Tuned Chatbots**: Developing and fine-tuning specialized AI chatbots for specific subjects will be addressed in a different module.
- **Advanced AI Applications**: Topics such as creating personalised learning experiences through advanced AI applications will be explored in future workshops.
- **Advanced Use of Other Specific AI Tools**: In-depth training on specific AI tools beyond introductory tips and tricks will be provided in other sessions.

This very first workshop is designed to lay the foundational knowledge, preparing participants for more advanced topics covered in subsequent workshops.

## Takeaways

- Participants will gain a foundational understanding of generative AI and its applications in teaching and learning.
- Practical skills in using AI tools (Spark, ChatGPT, others) to enhance educational practices.
- Awareness of ethical considerations and best practices for implementing AI in educational settings.
- Access to resources and examples that can be applied to their own teaching contexts.
- An ongoing opportunity to provide feedback and contribute to the evolution of the workshops.
