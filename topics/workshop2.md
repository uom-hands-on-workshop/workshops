## Workshop 2

### AI Cheating Lab (Coming Soon...)

**Think you've outsmarted AI?**
Join us for a BRAND NEW and ADVANCED hands-on, interactive experience where we'll challenge your assumptions, push the limits of generative AI, and equip you with clever strategies to stay ahead of the game. Ready to rethink what's possible? Stay tuned!



**Total Duration**: 90 mins  

**Objective**: Participants will critically explore the capabilities and limitations of generative AI tools in solving complex problems, learn effective strategies for overcoming these limitations, and collaboratively practise reframing assessment tasks to enhance academic integrity and meaningful learning.

**Recommendation**: Complete our [Introduction to Generative AI workshop](workshop1.md) prior to this one

**Pre-workshop preparation**: Participants are asked to think of a task, exam question, or assessment problem relevant to their teaching that they'd like to explore in this workshop.

**Please bring your computer to have fun with us :) (phone or tablet won't be enough but you can always pair up with someone else)**  


### Purpose of Workshop 2
This workshop aims to deepen participants' understanding of how students can use AI tools effectively and efficiently, even beyond apparent AI limitations. Through hands-on activities and structured scaffolding, participants will experience firsthand the ways students might leverage AI technologies. By critically reflecting on these experiences, educators will be better positioned to thoughtfully design, refine, and adapt assessments, thereby proactively addressing potential issues related to academic integrity and AI-assisted cheating.


### Expected Outcomes
Upon completion of this workshop, participants should be able to:

1. Clearly identify typical strengths and weaknesses of current generative AI tools.
2. Apply effective prompting strategies and tool integrations to address AI limitations in various problem-solving contexts.
3. Critically analyse and iteratively scaffold assessment questions and problems to enhance clarity, integrity, and AI-awareness.
4. Implement practical strategies to proactively minimise AI-assisted cheating and encourage meaningful student engagement in assessments.

### Out of Scope

- Comprehensive technical training on generative AI.
- Detailed exploration of ethical implications beyond immediate assessment concerns.
- Developing complete course redesign or full curriculum overhaul.
