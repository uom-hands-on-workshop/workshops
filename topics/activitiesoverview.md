# Activities

## Workshop 1: Introduction to Generative AI in T&L (Hands-on)

### Facilitator-led Activity [20 minutes]

**Objective**: Participants follow exact activities on their computers.

**Scenario**: Actioning feedback to enhance student experience in our subjects (real scenario – SWEN subject)

#### REAL SCENARIO: What would have improved your learning experience in this subject?

This report lists all comments entered by students.

```text
 - More refined/less vague project requirements 
 - Less workload – this is too much for student studying full time.
 - I think the lecture slides can be a bit challenging to read – especially the code part. I think the problem is that, when we try to put lots of code on one slide, then the text become rather small. Not sure what would be a better way though...
 - The project part 2 was far too big for the time given and I feel like some expectations for that part were not overly clear. I really enjoyed the subject otherwise 
 - Feedback needs to be provided sooner
 - Marking rubric for reports, extremely depends on tutor's personal feelings
 - Our team really felt the marking rubrics were under specified for parts 2, 3, and 4.
 - Even though the performance stuff was kind of tacked onto the end of the course, I'm really glad it was covered, as it wasn't something I had ever even considered when doing application development. In future, it would be nice to have a bit more guidance in this area.
 - Team members is not friendly 
 - Tutorials
 - I will appreciate if there could be more guidances on assignments in tutorials 
 - I would like more activities in classroom

#### Activity Steps:

1. **Problem Identification (human vs SparkAI)**
- **Task**: Identify problems in students' comments.

   a. (human) Write your list of identified problems in students' comments.

   b. (AI) Ask AI to identify problems in students' comments.

   c. (human & AI) combine the list of identified problems in students' comments.


2. **Prompt Engineering to Improve Outcomes From Initial Prompt**
- **Task**: Improve outcomes by considering additional context.

   a. (human) Write an improved prompt to list identified problems in students' comments.

   b. (human) Ask the LLM for some help to improve design a prompt to list identified problems in students' comments.

   c. (human) Compare prompts, merge and polish your final prompt.


3. **Selection of One Problem and Content Development**
- **Task**: Address issues related to rubrics and support teamwork.

   a. (human) Select one idea to be improved and developed with the support of AI

   b. (human) Ask the LLM for some help on what prompts could be used to help improving your chosen problem.


- **Supporting Teamwork**: Create an announcement or guidelines to support teamwork in SWEN90007, focusing on conflict resolution, collaboration strategies, and effective communication. Include examples and best practices.


#### Discussions about Misconceptions, Hallucinations, Ethics

- **Discussions (led by facilitators)**: Why are the suggested ideas good? Are there any research findings or best practices that support these ideas? Discuss any misconceptions or hallucinations that may arise during idea generation and how to address them.


### Hands-on Activities (T&L) [30 minutes]

**Objective**: Participants engage in T&L hands-on activities with facilitator support.
- **Task: Selection of Another SES Problem and Content Development** 

   a. (human) Select one new problem from the list below and interact with the LLM to find ways to address it. You should develop contents together with the LLM.


- **Task: Design Some Classroom Activities**: 

   a. (human) Interact with the LLM to address issues related to problem #11. You should chat with the LLM to identify options on how to promote classroom activities, select and develop one.

### Hands-on Activities (Tips and Tricks) [30 minutes]

**Objective**: Participants engage in day-to-day hands-on activities with facilitator support (focus on productivity boost).

1. **Tasting Plate of Activities**
- **Whiteboards**: From handwritten to typed notes (digitalisation of contents)

```{figure} resources/whiteboard1.jpeg
---
name: whiteboard1
---
```

```{figure} resources/whiteboard2.jpeg
---
name: whiteboard2
---
```

Task: Can you digitalise the two images above and combine them in one text using a LLM?

- **Meeting Minutes**: Documenting notes efficiently
- **Writing**: Emails (one-to-one communication), announcements (one-to-many)
- **Discussion Board**: Analytics on threads
- **Research**: Summarising papers, supporting analysis, managing citations & references
- **Proof-reading**:

#### Wrap-up [5 minutes]

**Objective**: Summarise the workshop and discuss key takeaways.
