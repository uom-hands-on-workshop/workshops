<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Analyse the following student comments to identify key problems and suggest actionable improvements. Provide the analysis in a structured format with headings for each identified problem, including a detailed description, suggested improvements, examples, and references. Consider the context of the SWEN90007 subject (Software Design and Architecture) (document here attached), including project requirements, workload, lecture materials, feedback processes, and team dynamics.

Student Comments:
1. More refined/less vague project requirements.
2. Less workload – this is too much for students studying full time.
3. Lecture slides can be challenging to read, especially the code part.
4. Project part 2 was too big for the time given and expectations were unclear.
5. Feedback needs to be provided sooner.
6. Marking rubric for reports depends on the tutor&#39;s personal feelings.
7. Marking rubrics were under-specified for parts 2, 3, and 4.
8. Performance coverage was good but needed more guidance.
9. Team members were not friendly.
10. Need more guidance on assignments in tutorials.
11. Would like more activities in the classroom.

Problem #1: Vague Project Requirements
- Description: Students felt that the project requirements were too vague, leading to confusion and a lack of direction.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Provide a detailed project requirements document with clear specifications, goals, and expectations.
  - Improvement 2: Include examples of what a successful project should look like to help students understand the requirements.
- Examples:
  - Example project briefs from previous years that were highly rated.
- References:

  - SWEN90007 Project 2022_v1.pdf (detailed project description).

Problem #2: Excessive Workload
- Description: The workload for the course was considered too heavy, particularly for students studying full-time.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Break down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks with staggered deadlines.
  - Improvement 2: Provide optional resources and extensions for students who need more time.
- Examples:
  - Introducing weekly milestones to ensure steady progress.
- References:
  - &quot;Managing Student Workload&quot; by John Biggs and Catherine Tang.

Problem #3: Challenging Lecture Slides
- Description: Lecture slides, especially those containing code, were difficult to read due to small text and dense information.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Use larger fonts and highlight key sections of the code to improve readability.
  - Improvement 2: Provide downloadable, annotated code examples separate from the slides.
- Examples:
  - Annotated code snippets provided as supplementary material.
- References:
  - &quot;Effective Use of Presentation Slides in the Classroom&quot; by Garr Reynolds.

Problem #4: Large Project Part 2
- Description: Part 2 of the project was too extensive for the time given, and expectations were unclear.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Reduce the scope of Part 2 or provide additional time to complete it.
  - Improvement 2: Offer detailed guidelines and examples of what is expected.
- Examples:
  - A clear rubric outlining the criteria for each section of Part 2.
- References:
  - SWEN90007 Project 2022_v1.pdf (detailed project description).

Problem #5: Timely Feedback
- Description: Students expressed the need for more timely feedback on their work.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Implement a feedback schedule with specific deadlines for when students can expect their feedback.
  - Improvement 2: Use automated tools to provide instant feedback on certain aspects of their work.
- Examples:
  - Mid-project review sessions to provide interim feedback.
- References:
  - &quot;Feedback in Higher and Professional Education&quot; by David Boud and Elizabeth Molloy.

Problem #6: Subjective Marking Rubric
- Description: The marking rubric was perceived as being subjective and dependent on the tutor&#39;s personal feelings.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Develop a standardised rubric with clear, objective criteria.
  - Improvement 2: Ensure that all tutors are calibrated and trained to apply the rubric consistently.
- Examples:
  - Rubric calibration sessions before the start of the course.
- References:
  - &quot;Developing and Using Rubrics for Assessment&quot; by Jon Mueller.

Problem #7: Under-specified Marking Rubrics
- Description: Students felt that the marking rubrics for parts 2, 3, and 4 were under-specified.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Provide detailed rubrics for each part of the project, specifying the criteria and weight of each component.
  - Improvement 2: Include examples of graded work to illustrate the application of the rubric.
- Examples:
  - Sample graded projects with annotations explaining the scoring.
- References:
  - &quot;Assessment Clear and Simple: A Practical Guide for Institutions, Departments, and General Education&quot; by Barbara E. Walvoord.

Problem #8: Performance Guidance
- Description: While performance topics were covered, students needed more guidance in this area.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Integrate performance-related content throughout the course rather than just at the end.
  - Improvement 2: Provide additional resources and examples related to performance optimisation.
- Examples:
  - Case studies on performance tuning in software projects.
- References:
  - &quot;Optimising Java: Practical Techniques for Improving JVM Application Performance&quot; by Benjamin J. Evans.

Problem #9: Team Dynamics
- Description: Issues with team members not being friendly or collaborative.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Facilitate team-building activities at the beginning of the course to foster better collaboration.
  - Improvement 2: Implement peer evaluation mechanisms to address team dynamics issues.
- Examples:
  - Team charters and conflict resolution workshops.
- References:
  - &quot;Team Building: Proven Strategies for Improving Team Performance&quot; by W. G. Dyer.

Problem #10: Guidance on Assignments
- Description: Students requested more guidance on assignments during tutorials.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Allocate specific time during tutorials for assignment-related Q&amp;A sessions.
  - Improvement 2: Provide detailed assignment guides and checklists.
- Examples:
  - Weekly assignment support sessions led by tutors.
- References:
  - &quot;The Lecturer&#39;s Toolkit: A Practical Guide to Assessment, Learning and Teaching&quot; by Phil Race.

Problem #11: Classroom Activities
- Description: Students wanted more activities in the classroom to enhance their learning experience.
- Suggested Improvements:
  - Improvement 1: Incorporate interactive activities and group work into lecture sessions.
  - Improvement 2: Use technology, such as clickers and online polls, to make lectures more engaging.
- Examples:
  - Real-time quizzes and interactive problem-solving sessions.
