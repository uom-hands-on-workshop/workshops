# Scenario (ESS 2022)

## Setting Context for Activity 1

The subject **Software Design and Architecture (SWEN90007)** at the University of Melbourne focuses on the in-depth study of software architectures, including the principles, techniques, and tools required for creating, developing, and evaluating these architectures. It covers a range of topics such as design styles, architectural patterns, design strategies, domain-specific architectures, and the evaluation of designs. The subject aims to help students analyse large-scale distributed systems, select appropriate architectures, and make suitable trade-offs between different architectural options.

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Analyse large-scale and distributed systems to select suitable architectures.
- Evaluate software architectures qualitatively and quantitatively.
- Make informed trade-offs between different architectural designs.

### Assessment

The assessment consists of a team-based project divided into three parts, submitted throughout the semester. Each submission focuses on various aspects of architectural design and implementation, with individual contributions moderated to ensure fair assessment. To pass, students must achieve at least 50% in the team-based project.

## [ESS 2022] What would have improved your learning experience in this subject?

This report lists all comments entered by students.

```text
 - More refined/less vague project requirements 
 - Less workload – this is too much for student studying full time.
 - I think the lecture slides can be a bit challenging to read – especially the code part. I think the problem is that, when we try to put lots of code on one slide, then the text become rather small. Not sure what would be a better way though...
 - The project part 2 was far too big for the time given and I feel like some expectations for that part were not overly clear. I really enjoyed the subject otherwise 
 - Feedback needs to be provided sooner
 - Marking rubric for reports, extremely depends on tutor's personal feelings
 - Our team really felt the marking rubrics were under specified for parts 2, 3, and 4.
 - Even though the performance stuff was kind of tacked onto the end of the course, I'm really glad it was covered, as it wasn't something I had ever even considered when doing application development. In future, it would be nice to have a bit more guidance in this area.
 - Team members is not friendly 
 - I will appreciate if there could be more guidances on assignments in tutorials 
 - I would like more activities in classroom
