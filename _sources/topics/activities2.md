# Activity 2 

## Activity 2 - Enhancing Student Experience 2.0

In this activity, you will have a go at creating a new teaching and learning resource using genAI. The goal here is to experiment and have a go, not to create a perfect final solution, so don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions and test different approaches.

## Task Selection 

**Objective**
Choose a resource to develop.

**Steps**
1. Continuing from Activity 1, choose an idea from the list (or add your own) to explore in more detail.
2. Example: Following is a list of potential resources you may want to develop:
   - Rubric
   - Course notes
   - Technical guide
   - Reading summary
   - Lesson learning objectives
   - Slides
   - Lesson plan
   - etc.

**Tips**
- Choose an idea that is feasible to be addressed and impactful.
- Ensure the idea is clearly defined before seeking AI assistance.
- Make sure that you have the relevant resources on hand to develop the idea (e.g., course notes, knowledge, any constraints or contextual information that is relevant).

## Content Development

**Objective**
Develop a resource with the aid of genAI.

**Steps**
1. **Develop a clear statement** for what it is you wish to achieve: You may want to use genAI to iterate and draft this statement. This statement will form the basis for a prompt and will also be used to evaluate the resource you create.
2. **Chunk the task appropriately:** GenAI tools generally work best when working on something small and well-defined. While it is possible to create whole documents in “one-shot”, this can often be prone to hallucinations or oversimplification. A better approach is to break the task down into smaller, more manageable tasks that can each be independently verified.
3. **Iterate with genAI** to develop material/content.
4. **Combine/refine:** Build up the resource by refining the output of AI and combining it together.
5. **Evaluate:** Evaluate the final output by referring back to the original purpose statement. This is a place where AI can also be quite useful to give another perspective on the evaluation, similar to you sharing your work with a colleague.
6. **Repeat:** Loop back through the steps as necessary until you have a quality resource that you are happy with.

**Tips**
- Working with AI should be an iterative process. Don’t expect to get a perfect result the first time.
- Also, don’t assume that you will get the same response with each generation that you do. If you don’t get what you want the first time you prompt it, you might get a better result by simply regenerating a response.
