# Workshop 1

## Introduction to Generative AI in T&L

**Total Duration**: 90 mins  
**Objective**: Equip participants with foundational knowledge of generative AI, educational applications, tips and tricks, ethical considerations, and LLMs (Spark, ChatGPT, others).  
**Expected preparation (pre-workshop reading)**: No prior reading required. **Please bring your computer to have fun with us :)**  
**Pre workshop survey**: TBC (add link here)

## Purpose or Workshop 1

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce educators to the fundamental concepts of generative AI and its applications in teaching and learning. No previous experience using generative AI is required. EVERYONE belongs here and is welcome to this session. 

In this initial workshop, we will navigate ways to collaborate with generative AI tools to address SES comments and improve students' experiences in our subjects. Participants will gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience with AI tools, learn how to apply these tools to enhance their teaching practices, and explore the ethical implications of using AI in education.

## Out of Scope

While this workshop aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to generative AI in teaching and learning, there are several topics that will not be covered in this session. These include:

- **Assessment Design**: Detailed strategies for designing AI-resilient assessments are covered in a separate workshop.
- **Creation of Fine-Tuned Chatbots**: Developing and fine-tuning specialized AI chatbots for specific subjects will be addressed in a different module.
- **Advanced AI Applications**: Topics such as creating personalised learning experiences through advanced AI applications will be explored in future workshops.
- **Advanced Use of Other Specific AI Tools**: In-depth training on specific AI tools beyond introductory tips and tricks will be provided in other sessions.

This very first workshop is designed to lay the foundational knowledge, preparing participants for more advanced topics covered in subsequent workshops.

## Workshop Overview

- **Intro [5 mins]**
  - Brief introduction to generative AI and its relevance in education.

- **Facilitator-led activity [20 mins]**
  - SES: Actioning feedback to enhance students' experience in our subjects (real scenario)
  - Problem identification (human vs AI, human and AI)
  - Prompt engineering to address one of the issues identified in the SES (human and AI)
  - Content development (human and AI)
  - Content evaluation (human)
  - Discussions about misconceptions, hallucinations, ethics

- **Hands-on activities (T&L) [30 mins]** (participants work individually)
  - SES: Actioning feedback to enhance students' experience in our subjects (real scenario)
  - Selection of another problem to be addressed
  - Prompt engineering to address one of the issues identified in the SES (human and AI)
  - Content development (human and AI)
  - Content evaluation (human)
  - Development of classroom activities (human and AI)

- **Hands-on activities (tips and tricks) [30 mins]** (participants work individually)
  - Tasting plate of activities
    - Whiteboards: from handwritten to typed notes (digitalisation of contents)
    - Meetings minutes: documenting notes efficiently
    - Writing: emails (one-to-one communication), announcements (one-to-many)
    - Discussion board: analytics on threads
    - Research: summarising papers, support analysis, managing citations & references
    - Proof-reading

- **Wrap-up [5 mins]**
  - Summary of key takeaways and next steps

## Key Activities

- **Facilitator-led activities**: Participants will engage in guided activities to understand and apply generative AI concepts in educational scenarios.
- **Individual hands-on practice**: Participants will have the opportunity to work on practical tasks, such as prompt engineering and content development, to enhance students' learning experience.
- **Discussion sessions**: These will provide a platform for participants to share insights, address misconceptions, and discuss the ethical considerations of using AI in education.

## Takeaways

- Participants will gain a foundational understanding of generative AI and its applications in teaching and learning.
- Practical skills in using AI tools (SparkAI, ChatGPT, others) to enhance educational practices.
- Awareness of ethical considerations and best practices for implementing AI in educational settings.
- Access to resources and examples that can be applied to their own teaching contexts.
- An ongoing opportunity to provide feedback and contribute to the evolution of the workshops.
