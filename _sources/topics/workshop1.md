## Out of Scope

While this workshop aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to generative AI in teaching and learning, there are several topics that will not be covered in this session. These include:

- **Assessment Design**: Detailed strategies for designing AI-resilient assessments are covered in a separate workshop.
- **Creation of Fine-Tuned Chatbots**: Developing and fine-tuning specialized AI chatbots for specific subjects will be addressed in a different module.
- **Advanced AI Applications**: Topics such as creating personalised learning experiences through advanced AI applications will be explored in future workshops.
- **Advanced Use of Other Specific AI Tools**: In-depth training on specific AI tools beyond introductory tips and tricks will be provided in other sessions.

This very first workshop is designed to lay the foundational knowledge, preparing participants for more advanced topics covered in subsequent workshops.
