This little guide aims to provide educators with an introductory understanding of AI literacy, covering fundamental concepts, practical applications, ethical considerations, and more.

AI literacy involves the ability to understand, use, evaluate, and create AI technologies. It encompasses a range of skills and knowledge areas that enable individuals to interact effectively with AI systems. 

## Importance of AI Literacy

AI literacy involves understanding these basic concepts and how they are applied in everyday life. It is crucial for educators to grasp these ideas to effectively integrate AI into their teaching practices and help students navigate a future where AI is ubiquitous.

## AI Literacy Phases

AI literacy can be conceptualised into four key phases: [Know and Understand AI](knowai.md), [Use and Apply AI](useai.md), [Evaluate and Create AI](evaluateai.md), and [AI Ethics](ethicsai.md). These phases provide a structured approach to fostering comprehensive AI literacy among educators and students.


## Conclusion

AI literacy is an essential skill for educators and students alike. By understanding, using, evaluating, and ethically applying AI, educators can prepare their students for a future where AI plays a significant role in various aspects of life. This guide provides a foundational understanding and practical insights to help educators embark on this journey.
