## Evaluate and Create AI

### Higher-Order Thinking with AI

AI literacy goes beyond knowing and using AI; it involves evaluating and creating AI applications. This requires critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

### Developing AI Projects

Encouraging students to create their own AI projects can deepen their understanding. Examples include:

- **Building Simple AI Models**: Using tools like SparkAI to create specialised knowledge about the subject you teach.
- **Creating Chatbots**: Developing chatbots that can assist with common queries.

### Evaluating AI Applications

Students (and ourselves) should learn to critically evaluate AI applications, considering factors such as accuracy, bias, and ethical implications. This can be done through class discussions, case studies, and project-based learning.

### Critical Review and Informed Decisions of GenAI

Every piece of AI-generated content should be critically evaluated and reviewed. Inspect/Examine the relevance, accuracy, and appropriateness of the content in the context of its use.
